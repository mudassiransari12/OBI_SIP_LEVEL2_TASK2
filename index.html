               Madhubala – An Actress So Beautiful that the Universe couldn’t Digest it ✨

            </p>

            <p>
               Madhubala, the most beautiful woman I have ever seen in the world it would not be wrong to say that she was too beautiful the universe could not tolerate the beauty and God took back his most beautiful creation. If being a teenager and so mesmerized with her beauty, I can't even imagine the craze for at that time. When she was alive, she was a global star and American magazine on quated “The biggest star in the world and she is not in Beverly hills".
            </p>

            <p>
               The golden name who is still missed badly by millions . Her posters and photos are still in demand
               She was beautiful internally as well as externally, her soul was as beautiful as her body was.

            </p>

            <p>
               She was popular for portraying strong and independent women characters on the screen. She was such a star that her name came first in credit before main lead ( Hero ).

               Perhaps god does not want take her to be old and still when we remember her a beautiful image comes in mind with a devine and mysterious smile . She is referred as the most beautiful actress to ever Grace on the silver screen !
               It was said that when Madhubala Smiled , the world Smiled. ❤️
